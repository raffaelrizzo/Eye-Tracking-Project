# Recording, Analysis and Visualisation of Eye - Tracking Data

For the first part of this project, we implemented a Dispersion Threshold algorithm and the UnEye Deep Learning Model (a Python 3 package using PyTorch)to analyse pre-recorded eye- tracking data. For both algorithms, we visualised and compared the mean fixation duration and mean saccade amplitude among others. For the second part of this project, we recorded Eye Tracking data by ourselves using the Tobii 5 Eye Trackers and GazeRecorder API. For the Tobii Eye Trackers, we created a website with an online dementia test based on the CERAD standard and performed tests with multiple subjects to find out, whether there are correlations between eye movements and dementia test results.
